    Below difference between interpolation and property binding is explained
    Interpolation does not work with boolean value as we can see in the first input field
    the 'disable' value is considered as a String in the interpolation but same working with Property Binding
-->
<input type="text" value={{name}} disabled={{disable}}> <!-- Example of Interpolation -->
<br> <br>
<input type="text" [value]=name [disabled]=disable> <!-- Example of Property Binding -->
